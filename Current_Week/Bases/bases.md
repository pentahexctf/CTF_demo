# BASES
Difficulty: intro

---
## TUTORIAL
* Humans use a number system called Base10 because we have 10 fingers.
* We count to 10 then move into the next DECIMAL (decimal means base10)
- We count to 10 then OVERFLOW into the next place
    * The OVERFLOW is set to 10
* In base2 the overflow is set to 2 and in base16 its overflowed at 16
```
Boundary is the base number
BASE2: 1 + 1 = 10
BASE4: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10
BASE5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 
```

```
Really common bases used in the world and in CTFs:
BASE64
BASE32
BASE16
BASE256
BASE2
BASE10
```

The letter/number system computers use normally is called ASCII, but wait does it also follow a base system?

You can also post emojis, write in Chinese, and arabic; Those are not numbers or letters though. This follows UTF encoding, the system was developed to supercede ASCII by using more bits to store possible characters, bit manipulation is a story for another time though.



## CHALLENGES

hint: What base is the encoded text in?
