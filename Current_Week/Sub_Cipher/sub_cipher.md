# SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS
Difficulty: intro

---
Cryptography have evolved greatly through humanity. Before computers encryption was nearly impossible so a much weaker thing called encoding was created.

* Substitution ciphers use a form of mapping
* ALL ENCODING ALGORITHMS ARE CRACKABLE

```
COMMON ENCODING METHODS:
Vingere Cipher
Subsition Cipher
    - Caeser Cipher
    - Braille
    - Base conversions
